 * \page installing Installing the library
 * \section configuration Configuration
 * The library's main static configuration file is located in `src/config.pri`.
 * Use this to set configuration options like debugging, the library's version,
 * the library's name and a link to the library's repository.\n
 * Keep in mind, the library should not be in debug mode for any production
 * code, since some of that debug information may involve private information.
 * (The library shouldn't be in production code until version 1, for that
 * matter)
 * \section compiling Compiling
 * \subsection qtcreator QtCreator
 * Just selecting the build target you want and hitting build should be enough.
 * \subsection terminal Command-line
 * The following commands should build the project for Linux:
 * \code
 * mkdir build
 * cd build
 * qmake -qt=qt5 ../QDiscord/QDiscord.pro
 * make all
 * \endcode
 * \section tests Tests
 * If you select the Debug build target, tests will be compiled. Execute the
 * resulting executables to run the tests, or use QtCreator's plugin to run
 * them automatically.
 * \section install Installing
 * Change your current working directory to the build directory and call `make
 * install`.\n
 * This will install the library into `/usr` by default. (`/usr/lib` and
 * `/usr/include`). To override this, call the command like this:
 * \code
 * PREFIX=/ make install
 * \endcode
 * \section docs Compiling the documentation
 * Make has an extra target named `docs` for generating the documentation.\n
 * If you wish to generate the documentation when compiling from QtCreator, add
 * a custom build step for make with the Doxygen file's directory as the working
 * directory and with the following arguments for make:
 * \code
 * docs --makefile=%{buildDir}/Makefile
 * \endcode
