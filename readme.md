# Updated QDiscord
QDiscord is a fantastic wrapper for the discord api written in C++, but it is lacking in some functionality and the project has been orphened. This repository is the most up-to-date version of this api (that I know of as of June 2020), with additional functionality added.


# QDiscord

QDiscord is a [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) wrapper for the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs) written in C++.
It was written to easily allow the creation of Discord bots.


**Currently it is in an incomplete state**, so expect things to either not work or not be available.

# Discord

[Discord](https://discordapp.com) is a proprietary Voice over IP application designed for gaming communities and is developed by [Hammer & Chisel](https://discordapp.com/company).
